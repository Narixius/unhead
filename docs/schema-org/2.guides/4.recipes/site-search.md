If your site offers a search function, you may like to define markup to help Google understand it.

## Define a Search Action

To provide a search action for your WebSite, you need to insert a SearchAction in `potentialAction`.

To make configuring this easier, the function `defineSearchAction` is provided.

Make sure that you set place `{search_term_string}` somewhere in your URL.
This represents a query a user would be searching for.

This markup should go in your root Schema definition.

```ts
import { defineSearchAction, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineWebSite({
    potentialAction: [
      defineSearchAction({
        target: '/search?q={search_term_string}'
      })
    ]
  })
])
```

## Define your Search Results Page

Using your [WebPage](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/webpage) Schema, you can define the page as a search results page.

```ts
import { defineWebPage, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineWebPage({
    '@type': ['CollectionPage', 'SearchResultsPage'],
  })
])
```
