Providing an identity may allow Google to display a prominent Google knowledge panel with details of the identity.

While Schema.org provides detailed types, it's recommended to choose a single provider below. If you're not sure which to use, you should select `Organization`.

## Organization

Selecting an Organization is the most common choice. It's recommended to use this if you're not sure which to use.

Tips:

- Doesn't need to relate to an official business
- Should be used for eCommerce that doesn't have a physical location

Example: [nuxtjs.org](https://nuxtjs.org), [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org)

```ts
import { defineOrganization, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization({
    name: 'My company',
    logo: '/logo.png',
    sameAs: [
      'https://twitter.com/company'
    ]
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

## Person

Selecting Person should be used when your website is about a person, a personal brand or a personal blog.

Example: [harlanzw.com](https://harlanzw.com), [antfu.me](https://antfu.me)

```ts
import { definePerson, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  definePerson({
    name: 'Harlan Wilton',
    image: '/me.png',
    sameAs: [
      'https://github.com/harlan-zw',
    ]
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

## Local Business

Selecting a Local Business should be used when your website is about a physical business, requiring an address.

Tips:

- Extends an [Organization](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/organization)
- Should be used for eCommerce that has a physical location

Example: [onacoffee.com.au](https://onacoffee.com.au), [intracbr.com.au](https://intracbr.com.au)

```ts
import { defineLocalBusiness, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineLocalBusiness({
    name: 'Harlan\'s Hamburgers',
    address: {
      streetAddress: '123 Main St',
      addressLocality: 'Harlan',
      addressRegion: 'MA',
      postalCode: '01234',
      addressCountry: 'US',
    },
    image: 'https://emojiguide.org/images/emoji/n/3ep4zx1jztp0n.png',
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

## Schema.org Node Relations

Once you've selected an identity, it will automatically be added to other relevant nodes:

- [Article](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/article): `publisher`, `author`
- [Product](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/product): `brand`
- [WebSite](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/website): `publisher`
- [WebPage](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/webpage): `about` (only for home URL `/`)
