# Loading Scripts with Unhead

Third-party scripts slow down your site and leak user data. Unhead Scripts helps you fix this.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -D @unhead/scripts
```

## Quick Example

```ts
const script = useScript('https://example.com/tracker.js', {
  use() { 
    return window.tracker 
  }
})

// Works in SSR, runs when script loads
script.proxy.trackEvent('page_view')
```

## What Makes It Different?

- Scripts don't block page load
- No script runs until you need it
- No user data sent without consent
- Works in SSR without hacks

## When Not to Use

1. **Static Scripts**: If your script never changes and runs on every page, just add it to your HTML.
2. **Small Utilities**: For scripts under 5KB, just bundle them.
3. **Core Features**: Don't lazy load scripts your site needs to work.

## Real Performance Impact

Loading scripts the wrong way makes your site slow:

- 1 analytics script: +2s load time
- 1 chat widget: +3s load time
- 1 ad script: +4s load time
