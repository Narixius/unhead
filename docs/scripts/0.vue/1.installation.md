## Introduction

Unhead is built for JavaScript applications that need to manage the head of their document in both server and client-rendered environments.

This guide is for installing Unhead Scripts with just Vue and no framework. Using a JavaScript framework? Select your framework below or continue with the Vue setup below.

## 1. Install Dependency

:ModuleInstall{name="@unhead/scripts"}

## 2. Use the composables

You now have access to the `useScript()`{lang="ts"} composable which can be used to manage your script tags.

```ts
import { useScript } from '@unhead/scripts/vue'

useScript({
  src: 'https://example.com/script.js',
  async: true,
})
```
