title: Tag Position
description: How tags are position in the DOM and how to configure them.
---

For non-attribute tags such as `<script>`, `<style>` and `<link>`, they are rendered by default in the document `<head>`.

But this isn't always useful. Sometimes you need to embed tags in different positions.

## `tagPosition`

The `tagPosition` attribute lets you control where the tag is rendered for tags that support it.

Possible values:

- `head` - Render in the `<head>` (default)
- `bodyOpen` - Render at the start of the `<body>`
- `bodyClose` - Render at the end of the `<body>`

Note:

- Sorting may not be stricly honoured when moving outside the head

## Examples

### Render a script at the end of the document

```ts
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/my-lazy-script.js',
      tagPosition: 'bodyClose',
    },
  ],
})
```
