The `entries:updated` hook is called whenever the collection of head entries is modified, either by adding new entries, updating existing ones, or removing entries. This hook provides a way to react to changes in the application's head content.

## Hook Signature

```ts
export interface Hook {
  'entries:updated': (ctx: Unhead<any>) => HookResult
}
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `ctx` | `Unhead<any>` | The Unhead instance containing the updated entries |

### Returns

`HookResult` which is either `void` or `Promise<void>`

## Usage Example

```ts
import { createHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

const head = createHead({
  hooks: {
    'entries:updated': (head) => {
      // Log when entries are updated
      console.log('Head entries have been updated!')
      console.log(`Current entry count: ${head.headEntries().length}`)
    }
  }
})
```

## Use Cases

### Tracking Head Changes

You can use this hook to track and log changes to head entries throughout your application lifecycle:

```ts
import { defineHeadPlugin } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

export const headChangeTrackingPlugin = defineHeadPlugin({
  hooks: {
    'entries:updated': (head) => {
      // Get current timestamp
      const timestamp = new Date().toISOString()

      // Log the updated state
      console.log(`[${timestamp}] Head entries updated:`, head.headEntries().map(entry => ({
        id: entry._i,
        input: entry.input
      })))
    }
  }
})
```

### Triggering Side Effects

The hook can be used to trigger side effects when head entries change:

```ts
import { defineHeadPlugin } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

export const headChangeReactionPlugin = defineHeadPlugin({
  hooks: {
    'entries:updated': (head) => {
      // Check if title has changed
      const titleEntry = head.headEntries().find(entry =>
        entry.input && typeof entry.input === 'object' && 'title' in entry.input
      )

      if (titleEntry) {
        // Perform side effect when title changes
        notifyTitleChange(titleEntry.input.title)
      }
    }
  }
})

function notifyTitleChange(title) {
  // Custom notification logic
  console.log(`Title changed to: ${title}`)
}
```

## Best Practices

::tip
When using the `entries:updated` hook:

- Keep your hook handlers lightweight as they'll run on every change to head entries
- Consider debouncing your operations if they're resource-intensive
- Remember this hook is called before entries are processed into tags
- Use this hook for tracking or triggering side effects, not for modifying the entries themselves
::

::warning
This hook is called frequently, so avoid performing expensive operations that could impact performance.
