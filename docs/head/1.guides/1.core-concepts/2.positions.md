description: How tags are positioned in the DOM and how to configure their order and location.

## Introduction

By default, tags are rendered in the document `<head>`{lang="html"} in a [specific order](#sort-order) for optimal performance and compatibility.

However, this is not always useful, say if you need to render a script at the end of the document or have a specific
placement of a tag.

::tip
Proper tag positioning is critical for performance optimization and can significantly impact page load times and user experience.
::

To solve these issues we have three options:

- [Document Placement](#document-placement): To control where the tag is rendered in the document (e.g. `head`{lang="bash"}, `bodyClose`{lang="bash"}, `bodyOpen`{lang="bash"}, etc)
- [Sort Order](#sort-order): To control the order of tags within the document section
- [Hooks](#using-hooks-for-tag-reordering): For advanced use cases, the `tags:afterResolve`{lang="bash"} hook allows programmatic reordering

## Document Placement

For the `<script>`{lang="html"}, `<noscript>`{lang="html"} and `<style>`{lang="html"} tags you may provide an optional `tagPosition`{lang="bash"} property with the possible values:

- `head`{lang="bash"} - Render in the `<head>`{lang="html"}  (default)
- `bodyOpen`{lang="bash"} - Render at the start of the `<body>`{lang="html"}
- `bodyClose`{lang="bash"} - Render at the end of the `<body>`{lang="html"}

::note
Using `bodyClose` for scripts that aren't critical for page rendering can significantly improve page load performance, as these scripts won't block the initial render.
::

### Common Use Cases

- **Analytics Scripts**: Place tracking scripts at `bodyClose`{lang="bash"} to avoid impacting page performance
- **Critical CSS**: Place essential styles in `head`{lang="bash"} with high priority
- **Polyfills**: Place in `bodyOpen`{lang="bash"} when they need to be loaded early but not block rendering

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/my-lazy-script.js',
      tagPosition: 'bodyClose',
    },
  ],
})
// renders
//   ...
//   <script src="/my-lazy-script.js"></script>
// </body>
```

## Sort Order

All tags are given a weight with the lower the number, the higher the priority.

[Capo.js](https://rviscomi.github.io/capo.js/) weights are automatically applied to tags to avoid [Critical Request Chains](https://web.dev/critical-request-chains/). As
well as default weights to avoid site stability issues:

- **-20**: `<meta charset ...>`{lang="html"}
- **-10**: `<base>`{lang="html"}
- **0**: `<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" ...>`{lang="html"}
- **10**: `<title>`{lang="html"}
- **20**: `<link rel="preconnect" ...>`{lang="html"}

All other tags have a default priority of `100`{lang="bash"}.

Escaping out of these default weights can be accomplished by setting the `tagPriority`{lang="bash"} property.

### Tag Priority

The `tagPriority`{lang="bash"} property can be set to an explicit weight, a string alias or a string to target a specific tag.

#### Sorting with Aliases

Using an alias to set the position of a tag is the best practice as it allows you to retain the existing capo.js weights
that are configured for performance.

- `critical`{lang="bash"}: **-8**
- `high`{lang="bash"}: **-1**
- `low`{lang="bash"}: **2**

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/my-lazy-script.js',
      tagPriority: 'low',
    },
  ],
})
```

#### Sort by number

When providing a number, refer to the priorities set for critical tags above.

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

// some layout we have a js file that is ran
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/not-important-script.js',
    },
  ],
})

// but in our page we want to run a script before the above
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/very-important-script.js',
      tagPriority: 0,
    },
  ],
})

// <script src=\"/very-important-script.js\"></script>
// <script src=\"/not-important-script.js\"></script>
```

#### Sort with `before:` and `after:`

If you'd like to place a tag before or after another tag, you can use the optional [Alias Sorting Plugin](/plugins/alias-sorting) which provides a more intuitive way to order your tags relative to each other.

::tip
The Alias Sorting Plugin is particularly useful when you need precise control over tag order but don't want to manage numerical priorities directly.
::

### Hydration Caveats

::warning
When hydrating the state (e.g., SSR or page switch), Unhead replaces existing tags in their current position to avoid a flash of content.

This may cause `tagPriority` to be ignored during hydration. For client-side-only applications or SPAs, this isn't an issue, but for SSR applications, be aware that the initial render positions may be preserved during hydration.
::

## Using Hooks for Tag Reordering

For advanced use cases where you need programmatic control over tag ordering, Unhead provides a powerful hook system.

The `tags:afterResolve`{lang="bash"} hook gives you access to the tags after they've been resolved but before they're rendered to the DOM. This allows for custom ordering logic beyond what's possible with `tagPriority`{lang="bash"}.

```ts
import { injectHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

const head = injectHead()

// Hook into the tags:afterResolve lifecycle
head.hooks.hook('tags:afterResolve', (ctx) => {
  // ctx.tags is an array of all tags that will be rendered
  // You can reorder, filter, or modify them before they are rendered

  // Example: Move all font preloads to the beginning
  const fontPreloads = ctx.tags.filter(tag =>
    tag.tag === 'link'
    && tag.props.rel === 'preload'
    && tag.props.as === 'font'
  )

  // Remove the font preloads from their current position
  ctx.tags = ctx.tags.filter(tag =>
    !(tag.tag === 'link'
      && tag.props.rel === 'preload'
      && tag.props.as === 'font')
  )

  // Add them to the beginning of the array
  ctx.tags = [...fontPreloads, ...ctx.tags]
})
```

::tip
The hooks approach is particularly useful for:
- Complex ordering logic that depends on runtime conditions
- Dynamic reordering based on user preferences or device capabilities
- Implementation of custom sorting algorithms for specific tag types
