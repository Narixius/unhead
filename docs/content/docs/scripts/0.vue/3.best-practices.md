## Avoid Watch and useHead

Avoid wrapping `useHead` in a watcher.

```ts
// bad
watch((title) => {
  useHead({
    title,
  })
})
```

This is because each call of `useHead` will add a new entry, which has its own side effects.

Instead, use a computed getter.

```ts
// good
useHead({
  title: () => title
})
```
