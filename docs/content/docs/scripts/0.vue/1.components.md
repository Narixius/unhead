The Unhead Vue package exports a `<Head>` component that can be used to manage your head tags.

While it's recommended to use the `useHead` composable as it offers a more flexible API with full TypeScript support,
the `<Head>` component may make more sense for your project.

The component will takes any child elements that you would normally put in your actual `<head>` and renders them
with Unhead.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { Head } from '@unhead/vue/components'
</script>

<template>
  <Head>
    <title>My awesome site</title>
    <meta name="description" content="My awesome site description">
  </Head>
</template>
