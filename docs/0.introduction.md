## What is head manager?

Unhead is built for modern JavaScript applications that need to render code outside their `<div id="app"></div>`{lang="html"} entry in both a
server-rendered and client-rendered environment.

JavaScript applications need different metadata for each page or view. Without proper management, applications encounter several issues:

Pages show incorrect titles and descriptions during navigation. Social media previews display wrong information. Search engines receive duplicate or conflicting meta tags. Server-rendered pages break when JavaScript takes over in the browser.

These issues affect SEO, social sharing, and user experience. They become more significant in server-rendered applications where metadata must work correctly during the initial page load and subsequent JavaScript updates.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>  <!-- ? htmlAttrs -->
  <head>
    <!-- ? head -->
  </head>
  <body> <!-- Unhead: bodyAttrs -->
    <!-- Unhead: bodyOpen -->
    <div id="app"></div> <!-- Your app -->
    <!-- Unhead: bodyClose -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Introducing Unhead

Unhead is built for modern JavaScript applications that need to render code outside their `<div id="app"></div>`{lang="html"} entry in both a
server-rendered and client-rendered environment.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>  <!-- Unhead: htmlAttrs -->
<head>
  <!-- Unhead: head -->
</head>
<body> <!-- Unhead: bodyAttrs -->
<!-- Unhead: bodyOpen -->
<div id="app"></div> <!-- Your app -->
<!-- Unhead: bodyClose -->
</body>
</html>
```

While many frameworks themselves implement solutions for managing the above tags, Unhead is a standalone library that can be used in any JavaScript application.

By being its own library, Unhead can innovate on the head management developer experience, providing an ecosystem of plugins and integrations that can be used across all frameworks.

## Why Use Unhead

Unhead solves these metadata challenges by:

- Synchronizing metadata with page content
- Removing old tags when they're no longer needed
- Managing page transitions without errors
- Handling both server and browser rendering

Built by the Vue.js ecosystem team and used in hundreds of production applications, Unhead provides a stable solution for metadata management across all modern JavaScript frameworks.
