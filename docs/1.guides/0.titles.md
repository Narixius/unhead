## Introduction

Page titles are crucial for SEO. They're your primary call-to-action in search results and help users understand your page's content and context.

```html
<head>
  <title>Mastering Titles · My App<</title>
</head>
```

While setting page titles with Unhead is straightforward, certain scenarios can be tricky. Let's start with the essential patterns you should follow.

## Understanding the Title Tags

The `<title>`{lang="html"}  tag displays text in browser tabs and typically appears as your page's heading in search engine results (SERPs).

In Vue, you might be tempted to set titles directly:

```ts
// ❌ Careful! This won't work in SSR
document.title = 'Home'
```

This approach has two major issues:

It breaks during Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Search engines may not properly index your titles

Instead, use Vue's head manager [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/) (already included in Nuxt).

## Dynamic Page Titles with `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

Now that we understand why direct title manipulation won't work, let's use Unhead's [`useHead()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/) composable to set titles properly:

::code-group

```ts twoslash [input.ts]
useHead({
  title: 'Home'
})
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

::

This single line creates an SSR-friendly title that search engines can read. The composable handles all the complexity of managing your document head in both client and server environments.

You can use this in any component and set any `<head>`{lang="html"} tag you like.

```ts
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to MyApp' }
  ]
})
```

## Setting Up Title Templates

You may notice that most people set up their titles with a site name and a separator, this is seen as a best practice as it
can help with brand recognition and SEO.

```html
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

Creating your own title like this is simple using `useHead()`{lang="ts"} with a [Title Template](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/guides/title-template).

::code-group

```ts twoslash [input.vue]
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s %separator MySite'
})
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

::

[Template params](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/guides/template-params) like `%s` act as placeholders that get replaced with your page title and separator.

### Template Params

You may ask why we don't just use a function for the title template, and while this is supported, it can create issues with SSR and hydration.

Instead, it's recommended to use the params. Out-of-the-box, Unhead provides:

| Token        | Description                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `%s`         | The current page title.                         |
| `%separator` | The separator, defaults to a pipe character \|. |

The `%separator` token is smart - it only appears between content and automatically removes itself when the title is empty or when multiple separators would appear.

Define custom template params to maintain consistent formatting:

::code-group

```ts twoslash [input.vue]
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
  templateParams: {
    seperator: '—',
    siteName: 'MySite'
  }
})
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home — MySite</title>
</head>
```

::

I'd suggest choosing your own separator as the `'|'` is a bit ugly in my opinion, you can try:

```ts
type Seperator = '-' | '—' | '•' | '·' | '❤️'
```

You can use template params in other head tags too, such as meta descriptions and open graph tags.

```ts
useHead({
  templateParams: {
    siteName: 'MyApp'
  },
  title: 'Home',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to %siteName - where we make awesome happen' },
    { property: 'og:title', content: 'Home | %siteName' },
    { property: 'og:description', content: 'Check out %siteName today!' }
  ]
})
```

### Resetting the Title Template

If you need to reset the title template for a specific page, you can pass `null` to the `titleTemplate` option.

::code-group

```vue [input.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: null
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

::

### Social Share Titles

Social platforms use different meta tags for sharing titles.

:FigureImage{src="/nuxt-x-share.png" alt="Nuxt X Share" lazy="true"}

In the above we can see the title "Nuxt: The Intuitive Vue Framework".

This title is set using the `twitter:title` meta tag and will fall back to the `og:title` meta tag if not set.

Remembering how to use the meta tags can be annoying, so we can use the [`useSeoMeta()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/composables/use-seo-meta) composable to set these up.

::code-group

```ts [input.vue]
useSeoMeta({
  titleTemplate: '%s %separator Health Tips',
  title: 'Why you should eat more broccoli',
  // og title is not effected by titleTemplate, we can use template params here if we need
  ogTitle: 'Hey! Health Tips %separator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
  // explicit twitter title is only needed when we want to display something just for X
  twitterTitle: 'Hey X! Health Tips %separator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
})
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Why you should eat more broccoli | Health Tips</title>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Health Tips: 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="Hey X! Health Tips - 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
</head>
```
