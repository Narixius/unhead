## Introduction

Nuxt exports several Vue components that can be used to manage your head tags.

While it's recommended to use the `useHead()`{lang="ts"} composable as it offers a more flexible API with full TypeScript support,
the Vue component may make more sense for your project.

## Usage

For full usage instructions please refer to the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/seo-meta#components).

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const title = ref('Hello World')
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <Head>
      <Title>{{ title }}</Title>
      <Meta name="description" :content="title" />
      <Style type="text/css" children="body { background-color: green; }" ></Style>
    </Head>

    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
